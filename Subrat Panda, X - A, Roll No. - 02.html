                <hr>
                <p>
                    Humans (biologically, Homo Sapiens) are considered to be the most advanced living beings in the world. We have developed a lot of changes to ourselves from what, we were originally. You all could see this everywhere! You all would surely have read in History books or have seen people using the word "Tribe" for the people, who live in the forest areas. According to me, they are the original humans as they are very close to the forest areas and the original form, in which a human was supposed to.
                </p>
                <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/Rc58f2778a24db91cc050959a5d7685c4?rik=2DCCQLLogEia6Q&riu=http%3a%2f%2fwww.thegoldenscope.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2014%2f02%2fcn_image-size-the-informer-a-voice-in-the-wilderness-11-111.jpg%3fw%3d470&ehk=s2iqmUIatlvzPw9rbOhSpOedSxLy3GasiE4omoXPEUw%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw" alt="Tribes & Forest">
                
                <p>
                    As the humans are becoming advanced, the human population is also increasing. This is a very big concern for many people and trusts like including the Government, Worldwide Associations like <a href="https://www.who.int/" target="_blank">WHO (World Health Organisation)</a>, etc. Now the question popping in many minds (after reading or listening about this topic for the first time) would be that Why Human Population is such a major concern?, What it would do to the Mankind? Let's see some of the consequnces:
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    So, the major reasons on the topic "Why Human Population is a sin?" are as follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>More population would demand in more requirements of each & every resource.</li>
                        <li>It would increase the demand in more land under the use of Humans, and also more area under farms for growing more food grains, which would be used to feed this large population. But, these 2 things can't get together. We would have to violate any one of them. The solution to this can be cutting down of forests (Deforestation) for more land. But, it would affect the environment adversely.</li>
                        <li>According to a report by <a href="https://www.un.org/en/" target="_blank">UNO (United Nations Organisation)</a>, the food requirements of the world would increase by 60-65% in 2050 (in comparison to today's needs).</li>
                        <li>Similarly, the needs regarding each & every factor would be increased in case of increase in population.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    So, Let's see that how the increase in Human Population would affect the environment. The key reasons for the same are as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>As the demand for each & every resource would increase, the demand for natural resources like Wood, Coal, Petroleum, Metal Ores, etc, would also increase. It is also estimated that for all these resources, human would be degrading almost all the natural resources & the environmental chain (on which every living being depends for surviving) would be disturbed.</li>
                    <li>Many more people would die due to hunger, and many wouldn't get enough resources, just to survive.</li>
                    <li>At these conditions, many selfish people would take an advantage & would relentlessly excercide their power over other people, who are unable to live without doing the task. </li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <img src="https://westfaironline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/population_increase.jpg" alt="Human Population (Increasing)">
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now, after knowing about the consequences of Increase in Human Population, let's see that "How can we stop this?". The points could be:
                    <ul>
                        <li>We must educate more & more people, as it would lead to more cooperation and less corruption.</li>
                        <li>We must use contraceptive methods in order to avoid Pregnancy, which would lead to birth of child.</li>
                        <li>We must educate people about the Sexual Health, so that they would keep the Birth Rate in control.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <q>With more & more people together, we can achieve the goal!</q>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.rhIgWz2mEK7_LnYM_IhKyAHaE7?pid=ImgDet&rs=1" alt="Unity among people">
                </p>

                <p>
                    At last, I would like to end my words by just saying that:
                    <q>When more & more people would understand the problem, more & more people would cooperate & would spread the awareness. By these methods only, we can solve this problem as <q>Unity is strength</q></q>
